## Recipe App

### Steps to Run the App
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file using Xcode.
3. Ensure your iOS Simulator or device is set up.
4. Build and run the app using the play button or `Cmd + R`.
5. The app should launch, displaying the main recipe list view. You can use the search bar to filter recipes and tap on any recipe to view its details.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
- **User Interface (UI):** I aimed to create a clean and intuitive interface for users to browse and explore recipes. The focus was on a seamless and visually appealing experience.
- **Networking and Data Handling:** Ensuring efficient data retrieval and caching using `RecipeService` and `ImageCacheService` was prioritized to provide a smooth user experience, even with slower network connections.
- **Search Functionality:** I implemented a search bar to allow users to filter recipes quickly, improving app usability.
- **SwiftUI Integration:** The project heavily utilizes SwiftUI to build responsive and interactive components, ensuring the app remains performant and modern.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
- **UI Development:** ~3 hours on designing and implementing the recipe list, search bar, and detail views.
- **Networking and Data Handling:** ~2 hours on setting up `RecipeService` and `ImageCacheService` for efficient data retrieval and caching.
- **Testing and Debugging:** ~1.5 hours for testing the application on different screen sizes and fixing bugs.
- **Code Review and Optimization:** ~1 hour for reviewing code for clarity and efficiency.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
- **UI Complexity vs. Performance:** I opted for a simpler UI layout to prioritize performance, ensuring that the app loads and runs quickly, especially when fetching and displaying images.
- **Local Caching Strategy:** Instead of implementing complex offline capabilities, I used a basic image caching mechanism to optimize performance without increasing development complexity.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
- **Error Handling:** The current implementation has basic error handling for network requests. It could be improved by providing more detailed user feedback and retry mechanisms.
- **Caching:** The image caching service is simple and might not handle cache expiration or memory management as efficiently as a more robust third-party library could.

### External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?
- The project uses the standard Swift libraries and SwiftUI for the UI components.
- I implemented a custom image caching mechanism rather than relying on third-party libraries like SDWebImage to maintain control over the functionality and keep dependencies minimal.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
- **Constraints:** The project was developed under a time constraint, so while the basic features are implemented, there is room for enhancement in areas like offline support, error handling, and more complex UI animations.
- **Scalability:** The code is modular and designed with scalability in mind. The ViewModel pattern separates business logic from UI, making it easier to extend functionality or integrate new features in the future.
